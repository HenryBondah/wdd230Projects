          <h2>Repetition</h2>

          <h2> Repetition is a great way to reinforce an idea. It’s also a great way to unify
             a design that brings together a lot of different elements. Repetition can be done 
             in several ways: via repeating the same colors, typefaces, shapes, or other elements 
             of a design.
            In the image above, the Rexburg fitness center has used repetition to make its website 
            looks good in the eyes of visitors. The repetition of the color violet makes it so 
            appealing. It could be seen as the background of the header though it's shaded with black, 
            light in the join now button, and also the body. The image also comprises violet and 
            together this makes it meaningful and nice. The text was also repeated to make it nicer.  
            With that being said, repetition in shot gives meaning and add value to a page when it's well used.</h2>

          <h2>Proportion</h2>
          <h3>Nissan</h3>

          <h2> Proportion is one of the easier principles of graphic design to understand. 
            Simply put, it’s the size of elements in relation to one another. Proportion 
            signals what’s important in a design and what isn’t. Larger elements are more 
            important, smaller elements less. From the view of this page I can see that there 
            is proportion though the first two cars doesn't have the same size but the designer 
            of the page wanted others to know the importance of it so they are place closely to 
            each other in almost same size. The the spelling of Nissan kind of used the same type 
            weight to make them look proportioned. Other cars in boxed below also portray repetition</h2>

          <h2>White Space</h2>

          <h2> White space—also referred to as “negative space”— is the areas of a design that do 
            not include any design elements. The space is, effectively, empty. Many beginning designers 
            feel the need to pack every pixel with some type of “design” and overlook the value of white 
            space. But white space serves many important purposes in a design, foremost being giving 
            elements of the design room to breathe. Negative space can also help highlight specific 
            content or specific parts of a design. There are so many white spaces on this site that makes 
            it clean though its a bit clustered and seem not to have so much balance.
            In some cases, negative space is used to create secondary images that may not be immediately 
            apparent to the viewer. This can be a valuable part of branding that can delight customers. 
            Take the hidden arrow in the FedEx logo, for just one example.</h2>
